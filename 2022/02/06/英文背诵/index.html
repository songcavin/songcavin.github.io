<h1 id="二"><a href="#二" class="headerlink" title="二"></a>二</h1><h2 id="1"><a href="#1" class="headerlink" title="1"></a>1</h2><p>Last week（发音wei）, I went to the theatre. I had a very good（d轻发音） seat. The play was very interesting. I did not enjoy it. A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. They were talking loudly. I got very angry. I could not hear the actors. I turned round. I looked at the man and the woman angrily. They did not pay（停顿） any attention. In the end, I could not bear it. I turned round again. ‘ I can’t hear a word!’ I said angrily. ‘It’s none of your business, the young man said rudely. ‘This（发音） is a（要发音） private conversation!’</p>
<p>north of China, some outings like surfing during summer time<br>diverse</p>
<h2 id="2"><a href="#2" class="headerlink" title="2"></a>2</h2><p>It was Sunday. I never get up early on Sundays. I sometimes stay in bed until（entil） lunchtime. （lench）Last Sunday, I got up very late. I looked out of the window（win发音）. It（连读） was dark outside（t轻读）. ‘ What a day! ‘ I thougt. ‘It’s raining again. ‘ Just then, the telephone rang. It was my aunt Lucy. ‘ I’ve just arrived by train, ‘ she said. ‘ I’m coming to see you. ‘ ‘But I’m still having breakfast, ‘ I said. ‘ What are you doing? ‘ she asked. ‘ I’m having breakfast, ‘ I repeated（re皮teid）. ‘ Dear me, ‘ she said. ‘ Do you always get up so late? It’s one o’clock’</p>
<p>QUESTIONS?</p>
<p>My hometown is in the northern part of China. People uaually do all kinds of outdoor activities diverse(different) outings in different season, such as going hiking when flowers are blooming, surfing in Tiger Beach during summer time, having a picnic or barbecue after the wheat(发音) harvest, and coming to  skiing on the river in winter.when people find the river is forzen they will come to ski</p>
<p>It belongs to Qixia District.<br>It is a small town called Yangshan on a lake. There are many universities near it.<br>The club went to the lake for a picnic in 2017.The reason why<br>The village is built in an antique style, so we all take many pictures.<br>It is（注意） such a peaceful place. The air also seemed fresh and pollution free. The atmosphere is so calm and quiet. There is also no noise pollution.</p>
<p>No, most young people don’t enjoy living in the countryside. Actually there are fewer facilities in the countryside. The entertainment facilities are also few in the countryside.<br>Old people prefer to live in the countryside, because they like the fresh air and the slow life of the villages.<br>Many people move from small towns to big cities in such a better career options and better facilities for their children.<br>There are many differences between the city and countryside people. In cities the people are more educated than the people of countryside because there are better educational facilities in the cities.On the other hand people of countryside are more hospitable and friendly. City people have very fast lives because of which they have lost the community spirit and have become self- centered. In villages people have slower lives and know their neighbours and still meet and greet each other. In cities people have become workaholics and going to another person’s house without an appointment nowadays is simply not acceptable.<br>Life has changed a lot in the countryside. That is better connectivity with the cities. The villages, which are near the cities, have developed a lot, whereas those, which are in remote areas, are still neglected.</p>
<h2 id="3"><a href="#3" class="headerlink" title="3"></a>3</h2><p>Postcards always spoil my holidays. Last summer, I went to Italy. I visited museums and sat in public gardens. A friendly waiter taught me a few words of Italian. Then he lent me a book. I read a few lines, but I did not understand | a word. Everyday I thought about postcards. My holidays passed quickly, but I did not send cards to my friends. On the last day, I made a big decision. I got up early and bought tirty-seven cards. I spent the whole day in my room, but I did not write a single card! </p>
